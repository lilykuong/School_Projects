 This program will display all such words, with the corresponding Scrabble score for each word, in decreasing
 order by score. For words with the same scrabble score, the words appear in alphabetical order. The program will
 loop until the user specify to exit by typing "." in the prompt.
 
 The program is able to take in any character but will disregard those that are not alpha letters. The program works
 on lower and upper case versions of dictionaries, but all processing will be case-sensitive. Ex: if the dictionary
 only has upper case, a rack of "MALL" would work but "mall" will not be able to find any words.
 
 There are two ways to compile this code:
 1) java WordFinder
      This will automatically use the sowpods dictionary.
 2) java WordFinder [dictionaryFile]
      This will use the dictionary file specified to find words.
 If the file specified (either explicitly or default one does not exist, the program will print an error message
 that consists of the file name and exit the program.

 Example output using sowpods dictionary for input "cmal":
 Type . to quit.
 Rack? cmal
 We can make 11 words from "aclm"

 8: calm
 8: clam

 5: lac
 5: lam
 5: mal
